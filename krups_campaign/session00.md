### Backstory detail
Born in Uberon, Found out to be half orc when 5, as punishment mother and father killed in front of him (mother first), enter rage mode and live in forest. Wander forest for a year learning to survive (trapping, hunting, camping, fishing, etc..)

Stumble upon Lorgashbur (lighter skin orcs) adopted by them, never felt at home, continued to wander but eventually kept returning. The clan packed up and left but I did not (adoptive mother "Mursha"). As a final gift they craft a greataxe him. He goes upon to the world and lives his life. 

Years later.. Village in mountain pass, beautiful landscape taking contracts killing undead and wolves. So liked by the inn and taverns given an apartment. One day a hooded man asks for help and offers a reward for protection across the mountain pass. 

Lonk accepts and goes to collect supplies. Old man introduces himself as Travish. 

+3 Gold upfront, promises more once they arrive. They set off after a toast. 

As we are walking, we are ambushed by undead looking wolves. Upon being attacked the wolves bleed black ichor.

After dealing with the wolves, Lonk and the old man (Dravish) find what appears to be a necromancer shrouded in darkness with a necklace of teeth (human and orc) The necromance calls Dravish's name. Lonk goes to attack but does not kill anyone. The necromance makes an attempt to enslave Lonk and make him apart of his personal army. The necromancer touches Lonk and paralyzes him (reduces health to 1 HP) Dravish steps in and gives Lonk a quest. To stop the spread of the darkness in the world. Dravish breaks the hold on Lonk by touching him, sperating the connection with the necromancer. As he does this, Lonk's tattos and eyes begin to emit a powerful blue light. Dravish opens a portal and throws him into it. Lonk blacks out...
